        <div class="subheading mb-5">NeuroscienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first generation student in my family and in seeing the sacrifices my parents have made for me has only given me motivation to keep going. In comparison to my siblings, I had the advantage to be born in the United States and make the best out of the opportunities that continue to be offered to me. At the same time, I discovered at an early age the direction in which career I wanted to accomplish. I knew that I wanted to work in the medical field because I want to help people like I have been helped. At the age of seventeen years old, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease that affects the thyroid glands. This disease is incurable and completely has changed my life forever. I understand the position patients that are facing similar circumilartimes, but I also see the perspective of patients that may find themselves in worst situations. This has made me much more appreciative of my life and given me the determination to follow the path to become a doctor. 
<br><br>

        Furthermore, I took it upon myself to learn more about the medical field by researching and interning at different places. During the Summer of my Junior year, I spent that time interning at a clinic where I got hands-on experience working with patients and shadowing the doctor. The doctor at the clinic was a physician that worked with patients of all ages, so it was interesting for me to observe sometimes what specialist patients would attend. Other times, it was interesting because every patient was different and I could never guess the reasoning to why they were coming in for. Lucky for me, I got to observe every patient that came in because my position was in the front office of the clinic. So, I also worked with the paperwork and attended the calls that came in. From there, I would assess patients by scheducing an appointment, transfering calls, or helping the patient in the best way I could. This experience gave an insight into the medical field and has encouraged me more to work towards that. 
<br><br>

        Therefore, I also applied myself to learn more about the sciences by exceeding the amount to take in high school. This challenged me because at the time I would take several advanced placement courses. However, although it was challenging I found myself to excel and it led me to choose the career I am now studying in college which is Neuroscience. With this my goal is to get into medical school after college and become an endocrinologist. I want to learn more about my own disease and assist people with my same condition in doing so. I know it can be having this condition and being a doctor that understands is helping towards a patient who can even be new to the condition. Currently, Iâ€™m searching for volunteer work I can do that involves working around medical professionals in hopes to only learn more and gain experience as well.
